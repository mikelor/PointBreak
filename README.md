# PointBreak
Point of Interest client app for learning Blazor Web Assembly. I won't be exploring Blazor Server implementations, becuase I don't find them as interesting.
PointBreak will be a simple client that tracks points of interest, similar to how you can "Save" places on Google Maps. 

## Some Resources I'm Looking Into

## GeoLocation
Since .Net Core 3, does not have a good geolocation class library (whereas .Net Framework has System.Devices.Location), I'm going to be leverage [Scott Shluer's](https://github.com/scottschluer/) [Geolocation](https://github.com/scottschluer/geolocation) library/nuget package.

Time to go.
